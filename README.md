Praxis 3 2020 Winter - Semester Project

Code for the rover proto to be able to operate and complete the task of delivering a charger plug to an electric vehicle's chaging port.
Due to COVID-19, the actual project had to be suspended for the future. The code here includes drive code, limit switch interrupts, and preliminary cv code. This may be revisited/finished in the future, but for now, that's that.
